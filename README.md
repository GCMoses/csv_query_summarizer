LIDA provides a Python API and a hybrid user interface for interactive chart, infographics, and data story generation.|

Here are some key features of LIDA:

AutoViz: LIDA leverages the language modeling and code writing capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs in enabling core automated visualization capabilities such as data summarization, goal exploration, visualization generation, infographics generation, and operations on existing visualizations such as visualization explanation, self-evaluation, automatic repair, and recommendation.

Data Summarization: LIDA summarizes data into a compact but information-dense natural language representation used as grounding context for all subsequent operations.

Automated Data Exploration: LIDA provides a fully automated mode that generates meaningful visualization goals based on the dataset. This feature is useful for users who are unfamiliar with a dataset.

Grammar-Agnostic Visualizations: LIDA provides methods to automatically improve visualizations via self-evaluation feedback or repair visualizations based on user-provided or compile feedback.

Visualization Recommendations: Given some context such as goals or an existing visualization, LIDA can recommend additional visualizations that may be useful to the user.

Overall, the csv_summarizer_lida project is a useful tool that can help users generate visualizations and infographics from CSV files using LIDA~
